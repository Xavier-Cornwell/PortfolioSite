(1, 'Creating a website for Battle Ground Rugby. I was assigned a team of 3 people(including me) in class, and tasked with creating a website for Battleground rugby, who recently changed their name to Chinook Rugby. We were to use WordPress for the website. Our color palette was to use Chinook colors which we translated as reds, blacks, and whites.\r\n', 'We had various goals for the website. One of them being to get people to sign up for rugby. Another goal of ours was to show the values Chinook Rugby has. These values are around comradery, and Teamwork. We figured the primary users of the webpage would be parents. So there was an emphasis on making the website more friendly to those who don\'t know much about rugby.  The website also needed to stay more sports oriented in looks and focus.\r\n', 'One of the biggest challenges we faced was the lack of content. We were content starved until the last few days. This made it a crunch to get the website together, as content really shapes the website. Website information architecture took a few revisions to get down. As well as a last minute change to the architecture for a better flow on the homepage\r\nFinding a theme that matched a more sport oriented website. Another challenge with the theme was that the documentation was hard and tedious to follow. This made development time take longer.\r\n', 'I learned about the process of making a website for a client with a team. Working of my communication skills in a team setting was a great experience. I was able to work on my written communication on slack as well as my face to face interactions with the team. I also learned the importance of content to a website. The big takeaway was working with a client, and how that process can look.', 'After the first meeting to get an understanding of the goals of the client, I would ask the client to send content such as images and copy writing ASAP.  I feel like the process would have been a lot smoother if we had content earlier. As we were starved for content, we  set out to make a basic example of how their page should be as a sort of content template to the website. The website is now up and they have added more content but the information structure stayed the same. So I think we succeeded in that part. The other Thing I would change would be doing more research on the theme.', 'I was assigned a team of 3 people(including me) in class, and tasked with creating a website for Battleground rugby, who recently changed their name to Chinook Rugby. ', 'I feel like we succeeded at hitting our goals. I think the website is friendly and inviting while still having a more aggressive sports feeling. We also receive some praise for our teacher Erin Lynch about the website. The website is up today as of 6/17/2019. It feels really rewarding having a website that I helped create as part as a team. I look forward to taking the skills I learned from this project and taking it to the next.', '2019-06-18 02:16:44'),
(2, 'This project was to create a responsive website of 3 pages in our teams, for class. We came up with the idea of making a pro-vaccine website due to the Vancouver measles outbreak. The entire webpage was made with Bootstrap 4. For this project I took on the role of the developer. The other members were the designer and the Project Manager.', 'Our goals was to create an informative site that displays facts about vaccines.\r\nWe also wanted to send people to relevant places and to where we got those sources.\r\nThe website will have a poll to get data from the users\r\n', 'This was my first time ever using Bootstrap 4 to code a website. Everything took longer than if we were using grid which I knew how to use. But due to browser support we decided to go with Bootstrap 4. I also had to break out some of my JavaScript skills to help do a transition of the title to being apart of the navbar. I also had a short period of time to translate the designs due to the due date.', 'I learned a lot about Bootstrap 4 especially the navbar. I learned Bootstrap 4â€™s grid system as well as other classes. I also developed my problem solving skills to get what the designer wanted. The title fade into the navbar wasn\'t perfect as the mock-up as I lacked time. This project helped manage my time expectations when it comes to developing a site. Another aspect I got to work on was my reading of documentation.', 'The landing page was cool, but something felt wrong when I looked at it but I couldn\'t figure it out. When we presented our website it was brought to our attention that we forgot the tagline of the website. I would go back and add that. I would also spend more time making a custom poll. Due to time constraints I decided to use a third party application for the poll. I believe that the website would be cleaner and look nicer if I spent more time crafting the poll page. As well as I could display the results of what other users  picked for their answers.', 'This project was to create a responsive website of 3 pages in our teams, for class. We came up with the idea of making a pro-vaccine website due to the Vancouver measles outbreak. ', 'Overall I am very happy with this website. Going from no Bootstrap experience, to making a webpage fully from bootstrap 4 was very challenging. In the end it was rewarding and I learned a new skill that I could take to other projects. I find Bootstrap 4 to be very good at building sites quickly, although it does have its limitations with overlapping. The problem solving of translating a design to code was also fun as it felt like a fun puzzle. I am quite happy with this project and as of 6/17/19 the website is live.', '2019-06-18 02:26:11'),
(3, 'I decided to do a review site of companies for my final project in my PHP class. The main technologies I used were PHP, MySQL, Ajax, and Bootstrap 4. Instead of designing the website from scratch with bootstrap 4 I decided to start out with a template to increase the time I could spend on making the website functional\r\n', 'The goal of this site was to use a dashboard style design to have a system where users can leave reviews of companies. The overall reviews would then be displayed on the home page with an average in heart ratings. Clicking on the profile of the image will then present you to the further into their page where you can see a short description, and other peoples reviews.', 'The more I worked on the website, the more I wanted to add other features for users. This lead to a problem of delaying working on the actual review part of the website. I had to make cuts on some features I wanted to put in to get a more complete website done. I also ran into a mental block of thinking of the features as big problems to tackle all at once. This further increased the delays on features, as I wanted to spend big chunks of time dedicated to coding rather than small chunks that would have been more efficient.', 'I believe even if I had been more efficient with my time, features I wanted to implement would had to have been cut. This project really helped me understand more about prioritizing specific features, and when to implement changes that wouldn\'t make development harder. It also taught me about scope creep and how it can lead my project the wrong way if I don\'t focus on the foundation of the website.', 'I would focus more on admin features. I feel like the website is really lacking in that part as of now. I would also write a list out of prioritizing features to work on. Instead of  working on whatever came up in my mind that day. I also would change the design of the homepage. It\'s very bare and could be more welcoming to users. Trying to implement tags that users and admins can use to describe the company would definitely be a nice edition. One thing that I was only able to do partially was the advanced search. It is very basic and could go over with more iterations and improvements. ', 'I decided to do a review site of companies for my final project in my PHP class. The main technologies I used were PHP, MySQL, Ajax, and Bootstrap 4.', 'This was a fun project to take from start to finish. Although it doesn\'t feel very rewarding because I don\'t feel like im finished. The code could definitely use some cleaning up as I was on build mode for most of the time working on the project. I will definitely try to continue working on this website as it is both fun and challenging. It can be a longer term project which I could always use the experience in.', '2019-06-18 06:35:29');
